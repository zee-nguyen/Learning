### Twitter Sentiment Analysis

A personal project to retrieve tweets data, categorize opinions expressed in the text, and determine whether the tweet's attitude is positive, negative, or neutral. The tweets are gathered based on a hashtag.

A three-point ordinal scale is used so we'll have 3 categories: Negative, Neutral, and Positive.
