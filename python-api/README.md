# Bike Map

## Part 1: Parse JSON

* Write some code to extract the coordinates from ride-simple.json
* Print the *first* 10 coordinate pairs to `stdout`. (There are almost 500 points and we don't need to see all of them.)

This is GPS data of a bicycle trip to Stripe's Seattle office, encoded as [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/).
