# API Development and RESTful Services

## 1\. Design and Implement a RESTful API

Exercise: Design a simple RESTful API for a task management application. The API should support operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

What to Practice: Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), design API endpoints, handle different response statuses, and validate input.

## 2\. Build a CRUD API

Exercise: Create a RESTful API for managing a list of users. Implement endpoints to create a user, get a user by ID, update user information, and delete a user.

What to Practice: Implement CRUD operations, manage request and response formats (JSON), and handle errors gracefully.

## 3\. API Authentication and Authorization

Exercise: Implement authentication (e.g., JWT) for your API. Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain endpoints and that users can only modify their own data.

What to Practice: Implementing authentication mechanisms, managing user sessions, and protecting routes.

## 4\. API Rate Limiting and Throttling

Exercise: Add rate limiting to your API to prevent abuse. Implement a mechanism to limit the number of requests a user can make in a given time period.

What to Practice: Understand rate limiting concepts and how to implement them in your API.

## 5\. API Documentation

Exercise: Document your API using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI. Create detailed documentation for each endpoint, including request/response examples and error codes.

What to Practice: Writing clear and comprehensive API documentation.

# Relational Databases and SQL

## 1\. Database Schema Design

Exercise: Design a database schema for an e-commerce application, including tables for users, products, orders, and order details.

What to Practice: Normalization, relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many), and indexing.

## 2\. SQL Queries

Exercise: Write SQL queries to: Retrieve a list of users who have placed more than five orders. Find the top 10 products by sales volume. Update the price of a product based on certain criteria.

What to Practice: SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions.

## 3\. Database Transactions

Exercise: Implement a transaction to handle a scenario where a user makes a purchase and the stock of the purchased items needs to be updated atomically.

What to Practice: Understanding transactions, commit, rollback, and handling concurrent access.

## 4\. Optimization and Indexing

Exercise: Analyze a slow-performing query and optimize it by creating appropriate indexes or rewriting the query.

What to Practice: Query optimization, understanding execution plans, and indexing strategies.

## 5\. Database Backup and Recovery

Exercise: Implement a backup and recovery strategy for your database. Simulate a data loss scenario and restore the database from a backup.

What to Practice: Backup techniques, recovery procedures, and understanding the impact of different backup strategies.

# Integration and End-to-End Testing

## 1\. Integration Testing

Exercise: Write integration tests for your API endpoints using a tool like Postman or a testing framework like pytest with requests.

What to Practice: Writing test cases, testing API endpoints, and verifying correct behavior.

## 2\. End-to-End Testing

Exercise: Implement end-to-end tests for a complete workflow in your application, from user registration to order placement.

What to Practice: Simulating real user scenarios, testing the entire system, and ensuring all components work together.

# Additional Tips

## 1\. Review and Refactor

Regularly review your code and refactor it for readability, maintainability, and performance.

## 2\. Mocking Services

Learn how to mock external services or components to test your API in isolation.

## 3\. Understand REST Principles

Make sure you have a solid understanding of RESTful principles, such as statelessness, resource identification, and hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)
